# YouTube Quiz Timestamper

Three pieces that work together:

1. **`scripts/extract_transcript.py`** — pulls the timestamped transcript for
   any YouTube video using `youtube-transcript-api`.
2. **`scripts/analyze_questions.py`** — sends that transcript to Groq and
   asks it to detect where each quiz question begins, returning a clean
   `questions_<id>.json` file: question number, start time in seconds, and a
   short label.
3. **`web/index.html`** — a quiz site. Click a question, click "Show
   solution," and the embedded YouTube player jumps straight to that
   question's timestamp (and stops automatically at the start of the next
   one).

## Setup

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api groq --break-system-packages
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
```

## Run the pipeline

```bash
cd scripts
python extract_transcript.py https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID --lang hi en
python analyze_questions.py transcript_VIDEO_ID.json
```

This produces `questions_VIDEO_ID.json`, e.g.:

```json
{
  "video_id": "VIDEO_ID",
  "questions": [
    {"number": 1, "start_seconds": 351, "label": "Income split between essentials and rent"},
    {"number": 2, "start_seconds": 448, "label": "Mixing two sugar varieties, no profit or loss"}
  ]
}
```

Move that file into `web/data/` and it's ready for the site.

## Wire it into the website

`web/index.html` currently has a sample dataset (25 questions from the demo
video) inlined directly in the `<script>` tag so you can open the file and
test it immediately — no server needed.

To load real generated data instead, replace the inline `QUESTION_DATA`
object with:

```js
const VIDEO_ID = "VIDEO_ID";
let QUESTION_DATA;
fetch(`data/questions_${VIDEO_ID}.json`)
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => { QUESTION_DATA = data; renderList(); updateProgress(); });
```

(Fetching local JSON requires serving the folder, e.g. `python -m http.server`,
rather than opening the HTML file directly — browsers block `fetch()` on
`file://` URLs.)

## How the "jump to timestamp" part works

The site uses YouTube's standard embed parameters — no video download or
re-hosting needed:

```
https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?start=SECONDS&end=SECONDS&autoplay=1
```

- `start` cues the player to that question's timestamp.
- `end` is set to the *next* question's timestamp, so playback naturally
  stops before it spills into the next solution.
- A fresh `<iframe>` is created per click, so switching questions always
  reloads cleanly at the new timestamp.

## Whole playlist, kept up to date automatically

For a playlist (e.g. ~60 videos) that grows over time, use the automated
version instead of running the two scripts by hand per video.

### 1. Local test run (optional but recommended first)

```bash
pip install yt-dlp youtube-transcript-api groq --break-system-packages
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
cd scripts
python process_playlist.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID" --out-dir ../web/data
```

This writes one `questions_<video_id>.json` per video plus a master
`web/data/index.json` listing every processed video (id, title, question
count). Re-running it later only processes videos not already in
`index.json` — cheap and safe to run repeatedly.

### 2. Push the repo to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Add secrets/variables (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

- **Secret** `GROQ_API_KEY` — your Groq API key
- **Variable** `PLAYLIST_URL` — the playlist URL

### 4. Enable the scheduled workflow

`.github/workflows/update-playlist.yml` is already included. It:
- Runs daily (cron `0 3 * * *` — edit to taste) and can also be triggered
  manually from the **Actions** tab
- Fetches the current playlist, finds any videos not yet in `index.json`
- Extracts + analyzes only those new videos
- Commits the new JSON files straight back to the repo

### 5. Turn on GitHub Pages

Settings → Pages → deploy from branch `main`, folder `/web`. Your site is
now live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/`, and every time the
workflow finds a new video in the playlist, the site updates itself within
one commit — no redeploy step needed since Pages rebuilds automatically.

### How the website now handles multiple videos

`web/index.html` loads `data/index.json` on page load to build the playlist
sidebar, then fetches the matching `data/questions_<video_id>.json` when you
click a video. Because it uses `fetch()`, you can't just double-click the
HTML file locally anymore — either serve it (`python -m http.server` from
`web/`) or rely on GitHub Pages once deployed.

### 6. Point the extension at the hosted map (one-time, ~30 seconds)

Once GitHub Pages is live, your map file sits at a public URL:

```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/data/mock-timestamp-map.json
```

In the extension popup, paste that URL into **"Timestamp source"** and click
**Save URL**. That's the only manual step, ever. From here on:

- The extension checks that URL in the background every hour (via a Chrome
  alarm) and refreshes its local cache automatically.
- It also refreshes on-demand if the cache is more than 3 hours stale at the
  moment you save a question.
- When you click **Save this question**, it reads the `MOCK-XX` label off
  the page, looks it up in the cached map, and — if a match exists —
  silently attaches the video ID + timestamp to that saved question. No
  extra click, no re-import, nothing to remember.

If a mock was added to the playlist less than an hour ago and hasn't been
picked up yet, click **Sync now** in the popup to force an immediate
refresh instead of waiting for the hourly alarm.

### How the pieces stay in sync automatically

```
New mock uploaded to YouTube playlist
        │
        ▼ (daily cron, or trigger manually from Actions tab)
process_playlist.py   → transcript + AI-detected question timestamps
        │
        ▼
build_mock_map.py     → joins timestamps to "MOCK-XX" labels
        │
        ▼
git commit + push     → web/data/mock-timestamp-map.json updated on GitHub Pages
        │
        ▼ (hourly alarm, or next question save if cache is stale)
Extension fetches the new map in the background
        │
        ▼
Saving a question on that mock auto-attaches its solution timestamp
```

Nothing here needs a local server, a manual import, or you running a script
by hand after the initial setup — the only trigger left is uploading a new
mock video to the playlist.

## Notes / next steps

- For long videos, `analyze_questions.py` sends the whole transcript in one
  call. If you hit token limits, chunk the transcript (e.g. by 20-minute
  windows) and merge the returned question lists, adjusting `number`
  sequentially.
- The AI step can occasionally mislabel a sub-step as a new question —
  spot-check the JSON before publishing, or add a lightweight admin view to
  the site for manually nudging timestamps.
- Add quiz options/answers by extending each question object with an
  `options` and `correct_answer` field, and rendering a real answer-choice
  UI above the "Show solution" button.
